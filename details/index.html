<p><strong>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>Distribution characteristics and influencing factors of medical and health service potential in built-up areas</p>
<pre><code>Supervisor: Sheng Jiao, Professor, Hunan University, 06/2022-05/2023

• Random forest regression and spatial regression are used to study the distribution characteristics and determinants of medical service potential in Central China's regions.

• Formulated recommendations for future healthcare development plans in these provinces, keeping in view the contemporary public demand for equal opportunities, diverse accessibility, and efficient procurement of high-quality medical services (Submitted to ‘Economic geography’).

<p>Impact of built environmental factors on COVID-19 infection at high-density communities: a case study in Shenzhen</p>
<pre><code>Supervisor: Rongpeng Zhang, Professor, Hunan University,08/2022-03/2023

• Identified and assessed the main built environment elements that affect COVID-19 infection rates in high-density communities in Shenzhen, while highlighting the differences in impact between high-density and regular communities. 

• Used Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Truncated Models to create a relationship between built environment factors and COVID-19 infection rates, conducting statistical analysis through R software. (Published in ‘Healthy Buildings 2023 Asia and Pacific Rim’)

<p>Analyzing the drive of Population mobility on epidemic risk in megacity using metro data</p>
<pre><code>Supervisor: Sheng Jiao, Professor, Hunan University, 10/2022-Until now

• Developed a theoretical model evaluating the connection between population mobility (considering travel distance and volume) and epidemic risk, based on metro data. 

• Utilized Shenzhen metro data to construct an index system, quantifying the impact of population mobility on epidemic risk, which facilitated the identification of varying risk regions.
